# PushToTalk

Here's a simple tool that gives you a choice to "PushToTalk" on windows for your any social applications.

When you start to use `PushToTalk` :

- it will `mute` your primary micphone.
- it will register `1` global hotkey (For now is - `MouseButton X2`).

### How to use

- Hold down `MouseButton X2` will temporarily `unmute` your micphone until you release the button.
- Tap the `MouseButton X2` more than `3 times in 1 second` , it will `unmute` your micphone for a long time. 
  - Actually the `unmute` status will until you tap the button again.

### TODO

The `MouseButton X2` is the button I am used to , so the TODO is the hotkey you can customize in a future version.
